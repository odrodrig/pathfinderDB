The wielder points the rod at the magic item, and a pale gray beam shoots forth to touch the target device, attacking as a ray (a ranged touch attack). The ray functions as a <i>greater dispel magic</i> spell, except it only affects magic items. To negate instantaneous effects from an item, the rod wielder needs to have a readied action. The dispel check uses the rod's caster level (15th). The target item gets no saving throw, although the rod <span class=\"grame\">can't</span> negate artifacts (even minor artifacts). The rod can function three times per day. </p>",
