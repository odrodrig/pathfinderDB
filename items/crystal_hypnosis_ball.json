However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes fascinated for 1d6 minutes, and a telepathic <i>suggestion</i> is implanted in his mind (Will DC 19 negates).</p><p>The user of the device believes that the desired creature or scene was viewed, but actually he came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the <i>crystal hypnosis ball</i> gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a servant or a tool. Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of his subjugation. </p>",
