During this period, any successful strike with the rod deals its usual damage <span class=\"grame\">and also</span> poisons the creature hit. This poison deals 1d3 Constitution damage per round for 6 rounds. Poisoned creatures can make a DC 16 Fortitude save each round to negate the damage and end the affliction. Multiple hits extend the duration by 3 rounds and increase the DC by +2 for each hit. The rod only functions if its possessor is evil. </p>",
