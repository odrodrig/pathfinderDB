The rod itself is about 4 feet long and weighs 10 pounds. It strikes as a <i>+1/+1 quarterstaff</i>. If the user throws the rod to the ground (a standard action), it grows to become a constrictor snake by the end of the round. The python obeys all commands of the owner. (In animal form, it retains the +1 enhancement bonus on attacks and damage possessed by the rod form.) The serpent returns to rod form (a full-round action) whenever the wielder desires, or whenever it moves farther than 100 feet from the owner. If the snake form <span class=\"grame\">is slain</span>, it returns to rod form and cannot be activated again for three days. A <i>rod of the</i> <i>python</i> only functions if the possessor is good. </p>",
