If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be removed only by application of a <i>remove curse</i> spell followed by a <i>cure disease</i> and then a <i>heal, miracle, limited wish</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell. The rotting can also be countered by crushing a <i>periapt of health</i> and sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon the <i>periapt of foul rotting</i> likewise crumbles to dust. </p>",
