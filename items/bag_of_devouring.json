            "body": "<p>This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a <i>bag of holding</i>. The sack is, however, something entirely different and more insidious. It is&mdash;in fact, one of the feeding orifices of an extradimensional creature.</p><p>Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to &ldquo;swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The <i>bag of devouring</i> is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls them inside as a free action. The bag has CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free.</p><p>The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a <i>bag of holding type I</i>, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a <i>wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>true resurrection</i> spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. </p>",
