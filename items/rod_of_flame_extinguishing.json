Continual magic flames, such as those of a weapon or a fire creature, are suppressed for 6 rounds and flare up again after that time. To extinguish an instantaneous fire spell, the rod must be within the area of the effect and the wielder must have used a ready action, effectively countering the entire spell.</p><p>When applied to Large or larger magic fires, such as those caused by <i>fireball, flame strike</i>, or <i>wall of fire</i>, extinguishing the flames expends 2 charges from the rod.</p><p>If a <i>rod of flame extinguishing</i> is touched to a creature with the fire subtype by making a successful melee touch attack, the rod deals 6d6 points of damage to the creature. This use requires 3 charges.</p><p>A <i>rod of flame extinguishing</i> has 10 charges when found. Spent charges are renewed every day, so that a wielder can expend up to 10 charges in any 24-hour period. </p>",
