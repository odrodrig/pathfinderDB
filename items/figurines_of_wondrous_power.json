The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects.</p><p class='stat-block-1'><b>Ebony Fly </b>: When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a pegasus but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects.</p><p class='stat-block-1'><b>Golden Lions </b>: These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for 1 full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects.</p><p class='stat-block-1'><b>Ivory Goats </b>: These figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly different from the others, and each has a different function:</p><p>Each of the several kinds of <i>figurines of wondrous power</i> appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.</p><p>If a <i>figurine of wondrous power </i>is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.</p><ul><li> <i>The Goat of Traveling</i>This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week&mdash;continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used.</li><li> <i>The Goat of Travail</i>: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.</li><li> <i>The Goat of Terror</i>: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a <i>+3 heavy lance,</i> the other as a <i>+5 longsword</i>). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates <i>fear</i> as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item<i>, animate objects</i>.</li></ul>",

Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: <i>overland flight, plane shift,</i> and <i>ethereal jaunt.</i> The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means. Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item,<i> animate objects, etherealness, fly, plane shift</i>.</p>",
