    "body": "<p>This weapon consists of a long wooden shaft with protruding handles and a sharp curved blade set at a right angle. Derived from a farm tool used to mow down crops, a scythe requires two hands to use, and is unwieldy but capable of inflicting grievous wounds. Its connotations as a symbol of death due to its association with reaping also make the scythe a particularly intimidating weapon.</p>",
