Any character who opens the work and reads so much as a single word therein must make two DC 15 Will saves. The first is to determine if the reader takes 1 point of permanent Intelligence and Charisma drain. The second is to find out if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom drain. To destroy the book, it must be burned while <i>remove curse</i> is being cast. If the grimoire is placed with other books, its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look of those other works. </p>",
