The item touched must make a DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder's Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder's is better. In such cases, contact <span class=\"grame\">is made</span> by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and <span class=\"grame\">cannot be used</span> again. Drained items are only restorable by <i>wis</i>h or <i>miracle</i>. If a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> and a <i>rod of cancellation</i> negate each other, nothing can restore either of them.</p>",
