The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress&mdash;even <i>knock</i> spells can't open the door.</p><p>The adamantine walls of an <i>instant fortress</i> have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i>, which restores 50 points of damage taken.</p><p>The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half).</p><p>The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty. </p>",
