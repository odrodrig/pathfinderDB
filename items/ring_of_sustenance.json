The ring also refreshes the body and mind, so that its wearer needs only sleep 2 hours per day to gain the benefit of 8 hours of sleep. This allows a spellcaster that requires rest to prepare spells to do so after only 2 hours, but this does not allow a spellcaster to prepare spells more than once per day. The ring <span class=\"grame\">must be worn</span> for a full week before it begins to work. If it is removed, the owner must wear it for another week to reattune it to <span class=\"grame\">himself</span>. </p>",
