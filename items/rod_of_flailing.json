The dire flail is a double weapon, which means that each of the weapon's heads <span class=\"grame\">can be used</span> to attack. The wielder can gain an extra attack (with the second head) at the cost of making all attacks at a &ndash;2 penalty (as if she had the Two-Weapon Fighting feat).</p><p>Once per day, the wielder can use a free action to cause the rod to grant her a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class and a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws for 10 minutes. The rod need not be in weapon form to grant this benefit.</p><p>Transforming it into a weapon or back into a rod is a move action. </p>",
