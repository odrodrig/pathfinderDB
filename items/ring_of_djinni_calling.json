It serves as a special <i>gate</i> by means of which a specific djinni <span class=\"grame\">can be called</span> from the Plane of Air. <span class=\"grame\">When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round.</span> The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring <span class=\"grame\">is ever killed</span>, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless. </p>",
