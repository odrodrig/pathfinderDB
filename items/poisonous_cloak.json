The garment can be handled without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned, the wearer takes 4d6 points of Constitution damage unless she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save. </p><p>Once donned, a <i>poisonous cloak</i> can be removed only with a <i>remove curse</i> spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a <i>neutralize poison</i> spell is then used, it is possible to revive a dead victim with a <i>raise dead</i> or <i>resurrection spell</i>. </p>",
