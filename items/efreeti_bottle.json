Periodically, a thin stream of bitter-smelling smoke issues from the bottle's top. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly amid a cloud of noxious smoke. There is a 10% chance (01&ndash;10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91&ndash;100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three <i>wishes.</i> In either case, afterward the efreeti disappears forever, and the bottle becomes nonmagical. The other 80% of the time (11&ndash;90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's effect. </p>",
