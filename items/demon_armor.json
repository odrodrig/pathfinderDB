The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This <i>+4 full plate</i> allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a <i>contagion</i> spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of <i>contagion</i> requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The &ldquo;claws&rdquo; are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed. </p><p>A suit of <i>demon armor</i> is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including <i>restoration</i> spells) while the armor is worn. </p>",
