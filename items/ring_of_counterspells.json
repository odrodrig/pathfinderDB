However, while it allows a single spell of <span class=\"grame\">1st</span> through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) <span class=\"grame\">may be placed</span> into it again. </p>",
