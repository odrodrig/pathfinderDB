The <i>Shadowstaff</i> makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and on Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The <i>Shadowstaff</i> also has these powers.</p><ul><li> <i>Summon Shadows</i>: Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a <i>summon monster V</i> spell cast at 20th level.</li><li> <i>Summon Nightshade</i>: Once per month, the staff can summon an advanced shadow demon that serves the wielder as if called by a <i>summon monster IX</i> spell cast at 20th level.</li><li> <i>Shadow Form</i>: Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by <i>gaseous form</i>. </li><li> <i>Shadow Bolt</i>: Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet. </li></ul>",
