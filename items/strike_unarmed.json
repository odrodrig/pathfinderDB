The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.</p><p>An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike. Unarmed strikes do not count as natural weapons (see Combat).</p>",
