This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination.</li><li> Another command word causes the <i>gem of brightness</i> to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.</li><li> The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.</li></ul><p>A newly created <i>gem of brightness</i> has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks. </p>",
