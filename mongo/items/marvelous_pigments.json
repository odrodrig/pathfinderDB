The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the image. One pot of <i>marvelous pigments</i> is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface. </p><p>Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 Craft (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. <i>Marvelous pigments</i> cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments&mdash;precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on&mdash;appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, glass, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp. The effect is instantaneous. </p>",
