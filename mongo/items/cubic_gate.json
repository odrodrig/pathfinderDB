Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a different plane of existence or dimension, one of which is the Material Plane.

There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the <i>gate</i>. It is impossible to open more than one <i>gate </i>at a time.</p><p>If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves. </p>",
