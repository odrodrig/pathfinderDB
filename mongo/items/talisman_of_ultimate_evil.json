The intended victim is swallowed up forever and sent hurtling to the center of the earth. The wielder of the talisman must be evil, and if she is not exceptionally foul and perverse in the sights of her evil deity, the good character gains a DC 19 Reflex save to leap away from the crack. Obviously, the target must be standing on solid ground for this item to function. </p><p>A <i>talisman of ultimate evil</i> has 6 charges. If a neutral (LN, N, CN) divine spellcaster touches one of these stones, she takes 6d6 points of damage per round of contact. If a good divine spellcaster touches one, she takes 8d6 points of damage per round of contact. All other characters are unaffected by the device. </p>",
