(Weeds, obstructions, and the like block vision in the usual manner.) If the command word is spoken, the <i>helm of underwater action </i>gives the wearer a 30-foot swim speed and creates a globe of air around the wearer's head and maintains it until the command word is spoken again, enabling her to breathe freely.</p>",
