Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the <i>doom</i> spell. The wearer also gains the additional power of a continual <i>deathwatch</i> effect and can use <i>fear </i>(Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week. Both lenses must be worn for the magic item to take effect. </p>",
