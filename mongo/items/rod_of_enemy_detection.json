These creatures can be invisible, ethereal, hidden, disguised, or in plain sight. Detection range is 60 feet. If the bearer of the rod concentrates for a full round, the rod pinpoints the location of the nearest enemy and indicates how many enemies are within range. The rod <span class=\"grame\">can be used</span> to pinpoint three times each day, each use lasting up to 10 minutes. Activating the rod is a standard action. </p>",
