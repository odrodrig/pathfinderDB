Once per day, if the archer swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the bow's whisper becomes the shout &ldquo;Death to those who have wronged me!&rdquo; Against such a sworn enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (and &times;4 on a critical hit instead of the normal &times;3). After an enemy has been sworn, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the archer takes a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the <i>oathbow</i>. These bonuses and penalties last for 7 days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the <i>oathbow</i>, whichever comes first.</p><p>The <i>oathbow</i> may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or 7 days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the <i>oathbow's</i> special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath. </p>",
